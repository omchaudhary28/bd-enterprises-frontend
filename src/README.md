I have successfully added the images and paragraphed information to the Fire Extinguisher Systems page as you requested. I also reviewed the entire project to understand its motive, which is to be a leading provider of fire safety solutions.

Here's a summary of the changes I made:

- Replaced the placeholder image on the Fire Extinguishers page with a relevant image.
- Added a new section called "Advanced Fire Suppression Systems".
- In the new section, I added detailed information and images for "Automated Fire Extinguisher Systems" and "CO2 Fire Suppression Systems".

I am unable to start the development server to visually verify the changes, but the code has been updated according to your request.
